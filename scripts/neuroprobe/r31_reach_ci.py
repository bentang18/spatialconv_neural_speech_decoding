"""Bootstrap CI and decision map for the LABEL-SAVING RATIO (the "30x fewer trials" number).

Every figure that draws the saving imports `_reach` from `v3_board_samplecurve` and prints a bare
point estimate. A point estimate is not enough to license the sentence the abstract wants to make,
because the sentence is an INEQUALITY ("at least k x fewer labels") and an inequality needs a
sampling distribution, not a mean. This script supplies that distribution and nothing else: it does
not redraw, refit, or re-aggregate anything.

═══ WHAT IS RESAMPLED, AND WHY IT IS SUBJECTS ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════
The claim generalizes over PATIENTS, so the bootstrap resamples patients, via the same `_subject`
map the gain-law bootstrap already uses. Two sessions of one patient are one draw, not two. Cells
carry their subject's multiplicity, which reproduces the cell pooling `_curve` performs.

═══ THE AGGREGATION IS IMPORTED, NEVER REIMPLEMENTED ════════════════════════════════════════════
`_reach` is imported. The panel below is a fast equivalent of `_curve` (cell means, then the mean
over cells, then the mean over tasks) and `--check` asserts it reproduces `_curve` exactly on the
all-subjects draw. If that assertion ever fails, the panel is wrong and no number here is valid.

═══ THE DECISION RULE, FIXED BEFORE THE NUMBERS ═════════════════════════════════════════════════
An inequality "at least k x" is QUOTABLE iff it holds in at least 95% of draws. The point estimate
is reported separately and is quotable as a point estimate regardless, because it is the mean of
the sampling distribution and no subject is excluded from it.

═══ THE TWO WAYS TO GET A WRONG ANSWER HERE, BOTH HANDLED ═══════════════════════════════════════
1. A draw whose pretrained curve NEVER reaches the baseline's full-data accuracy has an UNDEFINED
   ratio. Dropping those draws computes the saving only over resamples where the method works,
   which inflates every probability in the map. They are counted as FAILURES of the inequality and
   their share is printed. The percentile CI is necessarily over defined draws only, and prints how
   many it dropped, so the two are never confused.
2. A draw that already clears the target at the SMALLEST grid point is CENSORED: the true reach is
   somewhere below the grid, so the ratio is a lower bound and the upper tail is truncated. The
   share of censored draws is printed. Censoring biases the map DOWNWARD, so it is conservative for
   the inequality and must not be "corrected" away.

`n_full` is held FIXED at the full-sample median by default: it is the number of trials a
BrainTreebank session contains, a property of the benchmark rather than of our estimate, and
resampling it injects dataset-size variance into a quantity that is known exactly. `--resample-nfull`
recomputes it per draw so the choice is visible instead of assumed; both are printed side by side.
